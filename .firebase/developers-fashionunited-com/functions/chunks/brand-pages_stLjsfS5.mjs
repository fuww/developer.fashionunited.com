To make sure the image quality meets our standard, there are minimum\nrequirements:\n\n**For desktop:**\n\n- dimensions: 2560 x 526 px **Bigger image size = better**: nice to have (if\n  source image quality allows it) Example: 5120 x 1052 pixels or 3840 x 789\n  pixels. As long as the dimensions are the same.\n- resolution: 72 dpi\n\n**For mobile:** (this is not mandatory, but for a better experience on mobile\nyou can use these image settings)\n\n- dimensions: 1200 x 960 px **Bigger image size = better**: nice to have (if\n  source image quality allows it)\n- resolution: 72 dpi\n\nThere is no need to crop the images beforehand. **We can do that for you.** Just\nmake sure the image size is big enough to fit the header dimensions, preferably\nthose mentioned below.\n\n### Campaign images\n\nPlease provide up to 4 campaign images at a minimum of 72dpi and 280 x 350\npixels. **Bigger image size = better**: nice to have (if source image quality\nallows it) Example: 560 x 700 pixels or 840 x 1050 pixels. As long as the\ndimensions are the same.\n\n### Logo Requirements\n\nPlease provide a logo in a vector oriented format such as .svg, .eps or .ai.\n\nPreferably send us an .svg file.
