This allows people to not worry about having to setup an\ninfrastructure to handle vacancies and also generates far more traffic than\npublishing jobs on their own website.\n\nSome examples:\n\n[Asics Branding Page](https://fashionunited.uk/jobs/asics-jobs),\n[SMCP Branding Page](https://fashionunited.de/jobs/smcp-jobs),\n[VF Branding Page](https://fashionunited.de/jobs/vf-jobs),\n[GAB](http://www.gab.eu/jobs/)\n\nTo place this API in your own website, all you need to do is paste a bit of code\non any page or site you want for it to display. It is in fact more easy than\nembedding a YouTube video.\n\n```html\n<div\n  class=\"fu-embed-jobs\"\n  data-locales=\"\"\n  data-profile_id=\"\"\n  data-component=\"CompanyJobs\">\n  <script src=\"https://fashionunited.com/global-assets/jobs-embed/embed.js\" async=\"\"></script>\n</div>\n```\n\n_Bare minimum code for job embedder. Add locale and profile ID (to be generated\nby FashionUnited). Styling can be adapted to match any site design._\n\n```html\n<div\n  class=\"fu-embed-jobs\"~~~~\n  data-locales=\"en-US,nl-NL\"\n  data-category=\"Design & Creative\"\n  data-profile_id=\"2HycEba6EMxMYbyJN\"\n  data-keywords=\"fashionweek\"\n  data-limit=\"20\"\n  data-skip=\"15\"\n  data-component=\"CompanyJobs\">\n  <script src=\"https://fashionunited.com/global-assets/jobs-embed/embed.js\" async=\"\"></script>\n</div>\n```\n\n_Optional fields that can be added._\n\n## Attributes\n\n- data-locales: Comma separated list of locales to be displayed, all meteor job\n  board locales if ommitted\n\n- data-category: Name of category to be displayed, possible values:\n\n  - \"Design & Creative\",\n  - \"Internships\",\n  - \"Other\",\n  - \"Product & Supply Chain\",\n  - \"Retail Management & In-store\",\n  - \"Sales & Marketing\"\n\n- data-profile_id: mongodb \\_id of the profile to be displayed (to be generated\n  by FashionUnited)\n\n- data-keywords: keywords to filter on (same as you would type it in the search\n  field in the meteor job board)\n\n- data-limit: number of jobs to be displayed (default is 10)\n\n- data-skip: number of jobs to be skipped (for pagination)\n\n- data-component: which component to use when displaying jobs:\n  - \"CompanyJobs\": show the jobs for an external company page (default).\n  - \"HomePageJobs\": show jobs for our home pages.\n  - \"SearchJobs\": add a search box to the CompanyJobs.\n\n## Examples\n\n## Jobs Embedder\n\nGet the ID from the dashboard. Profiles > edit. The ID is in the URL. Set the\nlimit to _**100**_ jobs to show all the jobs for most companies. For those that\nhave more, it is not recommended to set this higher as the load would increase\nand the page will slow down.\n\n### Code\n\ndata-profile_id is used for selecting the company. FashionUnited can provide you\nwith your company profile ID.\n\n**Third-party site**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"fu-embed-jobs\" data-component=\"CompanyJobs\" data-locales=\"en-US,nl-NL\" data-limit=\"5\" data-profile_id=\"Y6Maua8gHEFRHuQTN\"></div>\n```\n\n### Simplified example, Pandora\n\n**Third-party site**\n\n```html\n<div class=\"fu-embed-jobs\" data-component=\"CompanyJobs\" data-limit=\"5\" data-profile_id=\"KfcXaKxq4XXjbeefY\"></div>\n```\n\n## News Embedder\n\n### Code\n\n**Third-party site**\n\nTo embed a list of 5 news articles from FashionUnited.com about Pandora, use the\nfollowing code:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"fu-news-embed\" data-field=\"fashionunitedComNewsArticles\" data-keywords=\"pandora,pandora-related,\" data-limit=\"5\"></div>\n```\n";
