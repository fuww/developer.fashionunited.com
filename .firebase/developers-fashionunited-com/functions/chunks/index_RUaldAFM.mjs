Also other\ninformation about the company, such as its different labels, statistics,\nhistory, video or images, it's all possible.\n\nExamples: [Adidas](https://fashionunited.uk/adidas),\n[Veldhoven](http://www.fashionunited.nl/veldhovengroup/),\n[Peek & Cloppenburg](http://www.fashionunited.de/pc%11Peek%11Cloppenburg/),\n[Grupo Cortefiel](http://www.fashionunited.es/grupo-cortefiel).\n\nImages supplied need to be high resolution 300dpi and can be supplied in JPG,\nPDF, TIFF, GIF format. Logo's are best supplied in SVG format. (see > SVG logo)\n\n### Images\n\n- Logo's are best supplied in SVG format. You can check this\n  [link](/docs/logo/).\n- Header images are best size 2200x400px. If header images are carousel, we have\n  limited maximum number of 4 images.\n- Other images are minimum size of 1200px wide, any height | minimum resolution\n  of 72dpi | BIGGER IS ALWAYS BETTER\n\n### Media\n\n- We can embed videos from Youtube or Vimeo – all we need is a link and of\n  course for the embedding option to be turned on for the specific video.\n- We can of course link to any social media account possible. For the most\n  common ones, we have logos ready for use, but if you need a link to a slightly\n  lesser known medium, please supply a vector oriented logo for that as well.\n\n### Content\n\n- In the current template of the branding pages, we've limited the maximum\n  number of tabs to 5. We strongly advise against the use of subnavigation\n  because this works against better SEO results. Instead we advise to write your\n  texts in such a way, that they are easily understandable and navigatable with\n  the 5 tabs.\n\n### Fonts\n\n- If a non-standard font is used, a licenced version has to be supplied. If that\n  cannot be submitted, we always use a font as similar to it as possible via\n  Google Fonts.\n- We have limited maximum number of different fonts to 2 in one page.\n\n## Banners\n\nWe deploy banners in various image and file sizes. Here's an overview:\n\n| Banner Name      | Format (px) | Max File Size (kB) | File Type |\n| ---------------- | ----------- | ------------------ | --------- |\n| Work for Brands  | 150 x 50    | 20                 | SVG only  |\n| Leaderboard      | 728 x 90    | 60                 |           |\n| Billboard        | 970 x 90    | 60                 |           |\n| Billboard        | 970 x 250   | 60                 |           |\n| Mobile Rectangle | 320 x 240   | 60                 |           |\n| Medium Rectangle | 300 x 250   | 60                 |           |\n| Half Page        | 300 x 600   | 60                 |           |\n| Newsletter       | 600 x 90    | 60                 |           |\n\n| File Types    | DFP Creative Type              |\n| ------------- | ------------------------------ |\n| GIF, JPG, PNG | Image                          |\n| TXT or HTML   | Third-party or DoubleClick tag |\n| HTML5         | html5-bundle &#8224;           |\n\nA destination URL must also be provided.\n\n&#8224; When building your HTML5 zip bundle, please follow the following\nrequirements:\n\n1.

News**\\\nFashionUnited is first and foremost a news platform, so our readers visit\nFashionUnited mainly to stay informed and up to date.

At the\nsame time, stories never stand alone, using the tag pages or related stories\ninterested readers will continue reading about your brand or business.
