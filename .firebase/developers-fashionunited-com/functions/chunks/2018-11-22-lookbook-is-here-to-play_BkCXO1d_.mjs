And since FashionUnited is all about content (remember those 5C's?),\nwhat better place to share fashion imagery?\n\nWell, we've got the solution. Or, to be honest with you, already had. Deep down\nthe interwebs you're still able to find _**My FashionUnited**_ where we have the\nlookbook. Up till now, over 60.000 images have been uploaded there, and the best\nof all, they're all fashion-related. Quality content! The place we provide\npeople to do so is, you could say, a little bit outdated. And as we wanted to\nuse Progressive Web App technology, which is also very interesting for our other\ncontent, we set out to build a new lookbook.\n\nItem video\n\nUpload video\n\nScroll video\n";
