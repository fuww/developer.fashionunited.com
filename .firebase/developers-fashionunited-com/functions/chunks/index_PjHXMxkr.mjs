						const body = "\n### Article structure\n\n- Titles: aim for a maxim of 60 characters. If using a quote in the title, use\n  single quotation marks\n\n- Article length: Ideally between 200-500 words for a non-feature article or\n  500-1,500 words for a feature article.\n\n- H2 (or subheader): Include H2s for featured articles. The longer the article,\n  the more H2s you should include.\n\n### Countries\n\nFor most articles, we can publish to all English speaking countries to expand\nour reach. So: UK,IE,IN,NZ,CA,COM. Exceptions to this would be if the news is\nhyper-local (a small brand opening a store somewhere) or news about a company\nthat only operates in one market.\n\nWhen publishing to UK, please always add IE as well.\n\n### Uploading to EXEC\n\nEXEC news is corporate news usually found on a company’s Investor Relations\npage. It includes, but is not limited to:\n\n- All trading updates\n- All acquisitions/stake sales\n- All investments\n- All exec hires or exits\n- Anything else published to a company’s Investor Relations page\n\nBecause of the way FashionUnited was set up, uploading EXEC news is a little\nmore tricky than regular news, but once you get the hang of it it can be done\njust as quickly.\n\nThe [Editorial cheat sheet](/docs/editorial-cheat-sheet/#executive-education) explains how we do it.\n\n### Quotations\n\nPlease use double quotation marks for all quotes except for A) If it’s in a\nheadline or H2 and B) For quotes within quotes. For these two exceptions, single\nquotation marks should be used here.\n\nFor anything that is not a quotation, for example, the names of collections,\nprogrammes, initiatives, exhibitions etc., single quotations should be used.\n\nQuotation marks are formatted in different documents, so sometimes can appear as\n“” and other times as \"\". Please be consistent with the ones you use.\n\nQuotation marks are not needed in a Q&A style interview. You can simply use H2\nfor the questions being asked and the paragraphs in between for the answers -\nthe context of the introduction of the article should make it clear who is\nspeaking.\n\n### Sources\n\nRemember to always include the source of your news in an article, whether that\nbe a rival publication, social media post, press release, press conference etc.\n\nPlease try to avoid referencing rival publications unless they have an exclusive\nstory and/or you can’t find any more information by searching online or\ncontacting the brand.\n\nPlease add your sources, such as the press release or link to another news\npublication, to your Trello card. This makes it easier for our other countries\nto pick up the news story, and also helps in the future if a brand asks us to\nchange incorrect information, by allowing us to see exactly what the editor was\nusing as a source.\n\n### Dates and numbers\n\nDates should be written in the following format April 10 2014, not 10\nApril 2014. No ordinal numbers so July 1 not July 1st; March 3, not March 3rd.\n\nIf the day you are writing about is in the current week, you can just use the\nday of the week. Eg: “...Nike announced on Monday”. If in the same year you can\nomit the year (because it’s already implied). So “In March…”\n\nWrite numbers 1-10 as digits, then numbers above that as numbers. So 9, 10,\neleven, twelve, thirteen etc. The exception is units of measurement (5 kilograms\nand 9 kilometres), percentages (6 percent) and in titles (5 spring-summer 2021\ntrends).\n\nNumbers over 1000 should have a comma, so 4,500, not 4500; 150,000, not 150000.\n\nTry to round to the second decimal place, so 5.29 billion euros not 5,289\nmillion euros. Convert thousands of millions to billions, so 5.29 billion euros\nnot 5,289 million euros.\n\nIf a specific time is used, rather than just ‘“on Monday”, for example, include\nthe timezone as we have a global audience. For example, “at 9pm GMT”.\n\n### Fashion seasons\n\nIn the body of the text please first use format spring/summer 2022 (no\ncapitals), and then afterwards you can use abbreviated SS22 format. You can\nwrite either autumn/winter 2021 or fall/winter 2021 (US news should lean towards\nthe former and UK news towards the latter)\n\nFor metakeys, we use FW22 and never AW22.\n\n### Symbols\n\nAll percentages are written in figures (not %) Eg: 1 percent, not 1%\n\nOther abbreviated terms should be written out Eg: Square feet (not sq ft), euros\n(not €), dollars (not $), pounds (not £), 400 euros (not Euro 400). For currency\nlike Swedish kroner (SEK) and Swiss francs (CHF), first write out the words with\nthe abbreviation in brackets. Thereafter you can use either the words or\nabbreviations.\n\nWhen writing dollars in an article, we assume it is US dollars. If using any\nother type of dollar (Canadian/Australian etc.), specify the first time which\ntype of dollar it is. You can then just write ‘dollar’ thereafter.\n\nAlso, note that currencies aren’t capitalised.\n\n### Brand/retailer/group names\n\nAt the beginning of the article (or at least once somewhere in the article) use\nthe company’s full name, eg: VF Corporation, Yoox Net-a-Porter, British Fashion\nCouncil immediately followed by its abbreviation in brackets (VF Corp, YNAP,\nBFC). From then on, you can just use the abbreviation.\n\nWe almost never use full capitalised names for brands, even though many write\ntheir own names like that. Even most acronyms (Asos, Cos, Adidas) we do not\ncapitalise. The exception to this is when the acronym is spelling out a name\n(LVMH, SMCP)\n\nAlthough we usually write ‘and’ instead of &, if it appears in a name of a\ncompany and therefore is part of their trademark, then it is kept the same\n(Marks & Spencer, Ralph & Russo)\n\nBrands/companies and groups are always singular. So “LVMH has decided” not “LVMH\nhave decided”; “H&M launches” not “H&M launch”\n\n### Race\n\nIn line with a growing number of news platforms, we are now capitalising the “b”\nin the term “Black” when referring to people of African descent. We already do\nthis for other proper pronouns like Asian, Hispanic, Latino, African American\nand Native American. The lowercase “black” just refers just to colour, not\npeople.\n\n### Job titles\n\nJob titles should not be capitalised. So “creative director”, not “Creative\nDirector”; “chief financial officer”, not “Chief Financial Officer”.\n\nExceptions are for acronyms so ‘CEO’, not ‘ceo”; “CFO” not “cfo”.\n\nFor SEO and readability reasons, try to alternate between terms like “CEO” and\n“chief executive officer” in an article if the term is repeated often. Writing\nthe full title out is particularly relevant if there are multiple C-level\nchanges discussed in one article.\n\n### Country names\n\nIn articles, please write “UK” and “US” not “U.K” and “U.S.”\n\n### Photo credits\n\nWrite credit as “Image: _____” In the space, add the company you’ve received the\nphoto from eg: “Image: Nike”. If you got it from social media, include that too\neg: “Image: Nike, Facebook”.\n\nAdd more info to photo credit if it makes things clearer, for example, if it is\nof a particular collection/event/person and you want to make that clear eg:\n“Image: Nike CEO John Donahoe, courtesy of Nike”.\n\n### Reporting on sustainability and avoiding greenwashing\n\nAs sustainability plays an increasingly important role in the fashion industry,\nwe have to be careful to report on fashion companies’ actions and pledges\naccurately and objectively. If not, we risk simply repeating and amplifying\ntheir greenwashing.\n\nBelow are some things to look out for when reading companies’ sustainability\nclaims, and how to be more critical about them:\n\n<b>Vegan fashion:</b> Just because something doesn’t use animal-derived\nmaterials doesn't mean it is more sustainable. Is it made up of harmful\nplastic-based materials, for example? Is it a product that would not normally\ninclude animal-derived materials anyway, and so ‘vegan’ is being added as a\nsuperfluous buzzword?\n\n<b>Biodegradable fashion:</b> A brand saying something is simply ‘biodegradable’\nis very vague. Technically, just about everything is biodegradable. How long\ndoes it take to biodegrade? Does it release harmful micro-plastics into the\nenvironment when it does? Has the company measured the biodegradability itself\nor has it been verified by a third-party company?\n\n<b>Recycled fashion:</b> Saying something is simply recycled, or contains\nrecycled materials, is very vague. What composition of a particular item is\nrecycled? What is it recycled from? Is it verified by the Global Recycled\nStandard (GRS)?\n\n<b>Context, context, context:</b>\n\nWhen covering sustainability in general, a good way to cover news without\namplifying greenwashing efforts by a company is to simply provide more context.\nFor example, you might report that a fast-fashion brand has released a\n‘sustainable’ or ‘conscious’ collection, but you can also mention that this\nlikely only comprises a tiny fraction of their complete range, and you might\nalso mention that the company has a poor history of churning out a lot of\nfashion and being a big part of the problem.\n\n<b>Certification: </b>\n\nFashion companies lend support to their sustainability claims when backing them\nup with certification. Some of the main sustainability certificates include\nBetter Cotton Initiative (BCI), B Corp, Bluesign, Canopy, Cradle to Cradle\n(C2C), Ecocert, Global Organic Textile Standard (GOTS), Peta, Fairtrade\nInternational, Global Recycle Standard (GRS), Regenerative Organic Certified\n(ROC), and Oeko-Tex.\n\nNote: While having certification is a positive sign, the process can also be\nexpensive, so a lack of certification, especially for smaller brands with\ntighter budgets, might not necessarily equate to greenwashing.\n\n<b>Low hanging fruit:</b>\n\nBe sceptical of ‘easy wins’ for fashion brands when it comes to sustainability\nactions. Sustainable packaging is an example of something we are seeing brands\nof all sizes introduce. Sure, it’s a small positive, but it will hardly offset\nthe damage they are causing.\n\nSimilarly, many brands are announcing carbon offsetting initiatives at their\nheadquarters. While a step in the right direction, their headquarters are often\na tiny fraction of the energy emissions created across their entire supply\nchain.\n\nWhile we can cover this news, mentioning that their efforts only mark a minor\nbenefit in the grand scheme of things paints a more accurate and honest picture\nfor our readers.\n\n<b>Vague, flowery language: </b>\n\nBrands love to use flowery phrases like “earth-friendly”, “saving the planet”,\n“protecting the environment”, “natural”, “eco”, “eco-friendly”, “organic”,\n“green”, “our most sustainable collection to date”. Without context these\nstatements could mean anything, so we should be sceptical about what they\nactually mean by them. Do they qualify any of those statements by saying\n<em>why</em> they use those adjectives? If not, we can leave it out. Where\npossible, try to use the words “more sustainable” rather than “sustainable” if\ntheir claim isn’t objectively verifiable.\n\n<b>When in doubt, use quotation marks:</b>\n\nIf brands use language or claims that they don’t back up, but you still think it\nis important to use in the article, then it is a good idea to use quotation\nmarks to make it clear that FashionUnited is not stating their claims as fact,\nbut simply quoting them. Quotation marks used in this way put the burden of\npressure on the brand and can even imply some degree of scepticism about the\nclaim in the article.\n\nClaims such as a “100 percent sustainable collection” and “our most sustainable\ncollection to date” mean nothing without context. In the first example, we don’t\nknow what the company’s definition of “sustainable” really is. For the second\nexample, being the “most sustainable collection to date” still doesn’t\nnecessarily mean it’s sustainable. By including speech marks we are making it\nclear that those are their words, and haven’t been verified by FashionUnited.\n\n<b>Asking companies for more information:</b>\n\nTo avoid simply copying brands’ ambiguous sustainability claims we should ask\nfollow up questions. If companies offer limited information, or don’t provide\nfurther clarification, mention that in the article.\n\n### Metakeys\n\nPlease use a max of five metakeys per article.\n\nWe are really trying to tidy up metakeys, which means making sure we are not\nadding unnecessary ones, and making sure the ones we do use are correct.\n\nWe have created a list later in this style guide to highlight some of the most\nused metakeys. If unsure what a metakey should be (eg. sustainability or\nsustainable fashion?), please check this document. If it’s not there and you\nthink it’s an important one, please flag it to Huw so it can be added to the\ndocument.\n\nWe currently have many superfluous metakeys, so please ask yourself if it’s\nreally necessary before adding. For example, names of people are interesting if\nit’s a big figure in the industry who is likely to come up several times in our\narticles (eg. Big designer or CEO). But if it’s a celebrity doing a one-off\ncollab or a new board member, a whole tag page isn’t necessary.\n\n### Style Guidelines - FashionUnited’s Voice\n\nPlease keep in mind that you are writing for FashionUnited and its readers, so\nyour tone of voice within your articles should be neutral and not overly biased\n(unless writing an opinion piece, which should be made clear it is such).\n\nWe do not include links to third-party pages - this also applies to appeals for\ndonations, charitable campaigns, etc.\n\nRemember that the content we publish should reflect what our readers (industry\ninsiders and professionals - not consumers) want to read and what they need to\nknow.\n\nWe are not a PR agency and do not write over-the-top marketing pieces for brands\nand designers, no matter how much we may like them (or dislike them).\n\nBe extra careful in this day and age about the word ‘sustainable’ and what that\nmeans. A brand’s ‘most sustainable collection to date’ is not necessarily\nsustainable at all. If they make these claims, make it clear that this is what\n**they** are saying, or justify why it is actually sustainable.\n\nChoose your words carefully when writing and avoid using overly descriptive\nadjectives or ‘colourful language.’ Although you may want to use many expressive\nterms when writing about a collection/style/individual etc keep in mind it needs\nto fit within FashionUnited overall tone of voice.\n\nStick to conveying the relevant facts and information within your articles and\ntry not to go off too much of a tangent. Remember to remain with your subject\nmatter.\n\nAlthough it may be tempting to write in a particular manner for your individual\ncountry, keep in mind FashionUnited has a wider audience on all its platforms.\n\nSpelling differences between US and UK are not too important, as we have an\ninternational audience, but if a story is about a US brand, then it makes sense\nto use US spelling. The most important thing is to be consistent within an\narticle.\n\nWhen writing Opinion pieces try to make sure that your viewpoints are\nconstructive and not overly negative or positive. (Good example:\n[D&G: When a fashion statement goes wrong](https://fashionunited.uk/news/fashion/d-g-when-a-fashion-statement-goes-wrong/2015031715886))\n\nFeel free to inject more of yourself and your personal writing style in Opinion\narticles, but try to keep in mind that the article’s tone of voice should still\nbe in line with FashionUnited’s tone of voice. It should not be overly casually\nor too business-focused, but still convey your thoughts and opinions in a clear,\ncohesive manner.\n\nWhen writing a personal or opinion piece you may be tempted to use the word ‘I’.\nPlease try to use this sparingly and only when relevant to the article in\nquestion. Try not to use ‘I’ to share your thoughts eg ‘I think H&M sucks’ but\nuse it when sharing an anecdote or story that is relevant to the article and\nhelps the reader relate or understand your point of view better.\n\nWhen writing Interviews choose carefully what information or quotes need to be\nincluded and what can be left out. Feel free to edit certain quotes to an extent\nfor your article, but do not rewrite what others have said to suit your purposes\nas the content must remain true to the speaker.\n\n### Vocabulary/common spelling mistakes\n\nFashionUnited **not** Fashion United or FU\\\nLondon-based **not** London based\\\nFashionUnited **not** Fashion United\\\nLine-up **not** lineup\\\nBrick and mortar **not** brick-and-mortar\\\nHigh street **not** high-street or High Street\\\nDirect-to-consumer **not** direct to consumer or Direct To Consumer\\\nTrade show **not** tradeshow or trade-show\\\nTrade fair **not** tradefair or trade-fair\\\nCovid-19 **not** COVID-19\\\nE-commerce **not** ecommerce or eCommerce\\\nFast fashion **not** fast-fashion\\\nSecond-hand fashion or pre-loved **not** secondhand fashion or second hand\nfashion\\\nWomenswear/menswear/kidswear **not** women’s wear/men’s wear kid’s wear\\\nOmnichannel **not** omni-channel Buy now, pay later or BNPL **not**\nbuy-now-pay-later Click and collect **not** click-and-collect or click & collect\n(Not to be confused with Collect+ - this is a brand)\\\nPrêt-à-porter **not** pret-a-porter\\\nReady-to-wear **not** ready to wear or RTW\\\nEBITDA **not** ebitda dollar, euro, pound **not** Dollar, Euro, Pound Marks &\nSpencer **not** Marks and Spencer or Marks & Spencers or M&S Asos **not** ASOS\nDr Martens **not** Dr. Martens Lands’ End **not** Land’s End Adidas **not **\nadidas Allsaints **not** All Saints ISawItFirst **not** I Saw It First Foot\nLocker **not** FootLocker Missguided **not** Miss Guided Pull & Bear **not**\nPull&Bear or Pull and Bear ThredUp **not** Thred Up JD Sports **not** JD Sport\nSports Direct **not** Sport Direct Frasers Group **not** Fraser Group Loungewear\n**not** lounge wear Officewear *_not_ *office wear Ralph & Russo **not** Ralph\nand Russo Brick and click **not** Brick-and-click E-tail **not** etail Flash\nsale **not** flash-sale Pop-up **not** Pop up Square metre **not** sqm\\\nSquare foot **not** sqft\\\nBillion **not** bn Million **not** mn Percentage points **not** ptts And **not**\n& Point-of-sale **not** point of sale Showroom **not** show room T-shirt **not**\nt shirt Gen Z **not** Gen-Z 90s **not** 90’s\\\n1990s **not** 1990's\\\nResale **not** re-sale\\\nLifestyle **not** life style Hanger **not** hangar Harrods **not** Harrod’s\nSainsbury’s **not** Sainsburys Boots **not** Boot’s Clarks **not** Clark’s\\\nPre-loved\\\nLike-for-like\\\nYear-over-year\\\nYear-on-year Colourway Millennial\\\nBaby boomer On-trend\n\n### Common Metakeys\n\n**Pricepoints:**\n\nDiscount\\\nPremium\\\nLuxury\\\nFast fashion\n\n**Retail:**\n\nHigh street\\\nRetail park\\\nFootfall\\\nStore opening\\\nPop-up (not pop-up store)\\\nDelivery\\\nReturns\\\nLogistics\\\nE-commerce\\\nSocial shopping\\\nMobile shopping\\\nApp\\\nBuy now pay later\n\n**Category:**\n\nChildrenswear\\\nWomenswear\\\nMenswear\\\nFootwear\\\nStreetwear\\\nAthleisure Activewear\\\nSecond-hand Bridal Beauty\n\n**Sustainability:**\n\nResale\\\nRental\\\nReuse\\\nRepair\\\nSustainable fashion\\\nRecycled fashion\\\nCircular fashion\\\nSecond-hand fashion\n\n**Fashion seasons:**\n\nSS22, FW22 and not spring/summer 2022, fall/winter 2022.
