Basically, what you work with in Adobe Illustrator. You can use SVG on\nthe web pretty easily, but there is plenty you should know.\n\n#### Why use SVG at all?\n\n- Small file sizes that compress well\n- Scales to any size without losing clarity (except very tiny)\n- Looks great on retina displays\n- Design control like interactivity and filters\n\n#### SVG requirements\n\nIn order to make the SVG images responsive in all the browsers it's important to\nfollow the following requirements:\n\n- Remove the height and width from the svg tags.\n- Add preserveAspectRatio=\"xMinYMin meet\".\n\nExample:\n\nSVG tag before:\n\n```html\n<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"underground-sign\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\nwidth=\"960px\" height=\"560px\" viewBox=\"0 0 960 560\" xml:space=\"preserve\">\n```\n\nSVG tag after:\n\n```html\n<svg version=\"1.1\" id=\"underground-sign\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"\nviewBox=\"0 0 960 560\" preserveAspectRatio=\"xMinYMin meet\">\n```\n\nThis will ensure that the SVG image will resize to any container.\n\nIn addition, the aim of this section is to ensure the maximun quality of the\nimages in any device specially smartphones. Thus, we strongly recommend to use\nthe path property for shaping the image instead of an image tag inside the svg\ntag.\n\n[Source: W3C](https://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/single-page.html#coords-PreserveAspectRatioAttribute)\n\n#### SVG at FashionUnited\n\nFor all job feed integrations and job postings we are able to use SVG. Logo's\nare therefore best supplied in SVG format.\n\nTLDR; If you want your brand to look best on the internet, on all devices, use\nSVG.\n\n## FashionUnited Logo Usage\n\nThe logo makes the link between fashion and uniting everyone working within the\nindustry, which of course the name FashionUnited embodies. It is displayed in a\nstylish and modern font, with an emphasis on the word United by making that\nbold.\n\nThe normal logo with FASHIONUNITED spelled together is preferred. But in terms\nof size, this is sometimes suboptimal, therefore the square version created. It\nmust always be accompanied by the circular logo with the F in it, or favicon.\n\nIn principle, the logo will only be used in black or in white. The background\ncolor or the image the logo is placed upon may vary in color, so obviously it\ndepends on that whether the white or black logo is to be used.\n\n![](https://developer-cdn.fashionunited.com/icon-logo-613x357.jpg)\n<br>\n\nThe FashionUnited circle, when used in this combination, should always have a\nheight of 400% of the FashionUnited letters.\n\nThe Full logo should always have a whitespace around it of the same height of\nthe FashionUnited letters.\n\n![](https://developer-cdn.fashionunited.com/icon-270x269.jpg)\n<br>\n\nThe whitespace arount the circle logo should always be 25% of the size of the\nlogo.\n\n![](https://developer-cdn.fashionunited.com/logo-572x87.jpg)\n<br>\n\nIf the text-only logo is used there aways is a minimum whitespace around the\nlogo of 50% of the height of the logo.\n\n![](https://developer-cdn.fashionunited.com/22-66-22-807x914.jpg)\n<br>\n\nThe logo can never be wider than 66% of the maximum width of the area it is\nplaced in.\n\n![](https://developer-cdn.fashionunited.com/onderbalk-802x914.jpg)\n<br>\n\nIf we make a screen or ad with a background image or background color, we always\nshow the logo in a white border on the bottom (which is 10% of the height of the\nimage.)\n\n### Download\n\nHere you can download the logo in various formats and packages:\n\n- [all FashionUnited logos in .ai format](https://developer-cdn.fashionunited.com/FashionUnited-ai-logos.zip)\n- [all FashionUnited logos in .eps format](https://developer-cdn.fashionunited.com/FashionUnited-eps-logos.zip)\n- [all FashionUnited logos in .svg format](https://developer-cdn.fashionunited.com/FashionUnited-svg-logos.zip)\n- [all FashionUnited logos in all vector oriented formats](https://developer-cdn.fashionunited.com/FashionUnited-vector-oriented-logos.zip)\n\nAdditionally, you can download the\n[complete logo stylesheet in .pdf format](https://developer-cdn.fashionunited.com/styleguide_FU_logo_2021.pdf).\n";
